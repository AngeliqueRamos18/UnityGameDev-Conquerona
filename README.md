# ðŸŽ® Conquerona - Unity Game Development School Project
**Status**: ðŸ›‘ Abandoned project\
This was a game I started back in senior high school along with my team for our school project.
Take note that I only got as far as making a playable demo before we decided not to continue it.
It's incompete, unpolished, and prolly staying that way -- however, you're welcome to take a look.
## ðŸ“Œ Theme
The theme of the game is related to **COVID-19 pandemic**.
## ðŸŽ¯ Goal
Our goal here is to create a playable demo, at least with working basic functions of the game. Player movements, dialogues, menu, a few scenes, and so on..

> Note: my role here in the team is that I am responsible for handling the backend part of the game development, where I create functions, logic, events, and more. Thanks to Xena Tec (Art Team Leader) & her team for the visuals,
> as well as Chrisel Algario (Music Team Leader) & his team for the audio which they have contributed in this Game Dev Project.
