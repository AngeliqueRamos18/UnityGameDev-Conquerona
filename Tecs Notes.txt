NOTES =============
	The reason why you can't see the npcs in the quarantineCamp is because the variables automatically sets to 1 instead of 0. 	
		Can be recreated through playing the actual scene first instead of starting from the menu.
		If started from the menu, it works alright.
		A bit troublesome to manually enable the npcs but it's alright 
	Fade in on OutsideTheTruck does not work 
	Fade out when destroying coco, maria, and veteran when the dialouge is done does not work. It feels sudden
