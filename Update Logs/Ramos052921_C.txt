Note for Xena:
	To create restart button, create a script first then make
	a function called Restart();

	import also on the top this code
	using UnityEngine.SceneManagement;

	Restart(){
		SceneManager.LoadScene(# of Scene of the current battlemode);
		// you can check it in File > Build project > and the number
		of the scene
	}

	Create button, then attach the script, in the onclick function,
	drag the button there and call the function Restart();
